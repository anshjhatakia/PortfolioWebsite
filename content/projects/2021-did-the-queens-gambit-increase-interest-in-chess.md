As many of you probably know, *The Office* was savagely taken off of Netflix on January 1st, 2021, leaving me and millions of other fans in the dust with nothing to watch other than about 4000 other shows and movies. The disappointment and sense of betrayal made it hard to look at Netflix in the screen. But eventually, after one whole day, I found forgiveness in my heart and decided to give the streaming service another chance. I logged in and started looking through the “Recommended for You” section when I stumbled upon *The Queen’s Gambit*. The show looked interesting and I had heard great things about it, so I decided to give it a spin.

*The Queen’s Gambit* follows a prodigious chess player named Elizabeth Harmon who rises up the ranks in the chess world while navigating through the struggles of substance abuse, a troubled past, and her personal relationships. The show is highly atmospheric and immaculately cast. I absolutely loved it and would recommend it to anyone who likes good things. I liked it so much, in fact, that I decided to give chess another try. This is a big deal, people. Hearing my history with chess is enough to put most people on antidepressants. I remember being a participant in the chess club in the 4th grade and losing every single game I played the entire year (ok, I got a draw in one game, but mentioning that would make my statement less impactful). 

Anyway, my newfound interest in chess made me curious if anyone else got interested in the game after watching the show too. In December of 2020, CNN reported that “a record 62 million households watched *The Queen’s Gambit* in its first month”. Surely, it’s plausible right the show garnered substantial interest in chess, right?

**I decided to measure interest in three different ways:** 

1. **Internet Searches:** Did more people make internet searches related to chess after the show was released?
2. **Chess Community Growth:** How did growth rates of popular chess-related subreddits change after the show was released?
3. **Online Chess Growth:** Did online chess websites and applications see user growth after the show was released?

To answer these questions, I found and created the necessary datasets, cleaned them in Excel, and finally transferred them into Tableau to make them look pretty.

### ***Internet Searches:***

To measure interest through internet searches, I used Google’s Trends Tool. I acquired data for the keywords “the queens gambit” and “chess”. The first step was to make sure that interest in these two keywords has similar growth patterns. Doing this would help me determine if there was a meaningful connection between the game and the show.
